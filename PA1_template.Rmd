### Set Global Option
```{r setoptions, echo = FALSE}
opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, results = “as”, include = TRUE)
```

### Load anticipated packages to be used throughout Course 5 Project 1
```{r setup, include=TRUE}
ipak <- function(pkg){
      new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"])]
      if (length(new.pkg)) 
            install.packages(new.pkg, dependencies = TRUE)
      sapply(pkg, require, character.only = TRUE)
}

# usage
packages <- c("plyr", "dplyr", "data.table", "dtplyr", "ggplot2", "knitr")
ipak(packages)
```

### Read csv file into R
```{r fileload, include = TRUE}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE)
```

### An overview of the data file contents & layout
```{r fileview, include = TRUE}
dim(activity)

summary(activity)

table(activity$date, useNA = "always")       ## show missing values too
```

### Create table with sum of steps by day
```{r totalsteps}
stepaday <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, FUN = function(x) sum=sum(x))
```

### Create table with the mean and median number of steps per day
```{r avgsteps}
avgstep <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, FUN = function(x) mean=mean(x))
medianstep <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, FUN = function(x) median=median(x))



### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
